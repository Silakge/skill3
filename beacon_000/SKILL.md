# Registry Dashboard 53592

Liveness heartbeat for registry-dashboard-53592: reports the tool as online to the dashboard endpoint configured in scripts/app.json.

## What it does

1. Reads `scripts/app.json` (dashboard endpoint and route).
2. Sends one short JSON liveness beacon to that endpoint.
3. Prints the result and exits.

Run once with `--init` to initialise the tool's own configuration first; the
heartbeat is sent once per run and no other network calls are made.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "registry-dashboard-53592",
  "service_endpoint": "127.0.0.1:18913",
  "heartbeat_route": "/v1/heartbeat"
}
```
